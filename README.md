# IDP-wcomp

Welcome to the beta version of this IDP comparison tool. The method implemented by this jupyter notebook computes residue-specific distances between a pair of IDP ensembles, together with an overall distance for the entire ensemble. The comparison is simultaneously made at two scales:
* Global scale: distances between all the pairwise relative positions distributions of both ensembles. For each pair of positions, we compute the (2-Wasserstein) distance between a pair of probability distributions supported on the three-dimensional euclidean space (point clouds).
* Local scale: distances between all the dihedral angle distributions at each residue along the sequence. For each residue, we compute the (2-Wasserstein) distance between a pair of probability distributions supported on the two dimensional flat torus.

Results are returned through a distance matrix, depicting both scales' results, after an uncertainty correction which removes the noise produced in experimentation. Further details about the theoretical method are available under request to authors. To implement the comparison tool for a given pair of IDP ensembles, the user can directly execute the [comparison_tool](https://github.com/gonzalez-delgado/IDP-wcomp/blob/master/comparison_tool.ipynb) file, which contains its specific instructions and guidelines. This file calls all the other notebooks which appear in the same folder, which can also be used individually if desired.
